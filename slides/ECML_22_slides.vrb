\frametitle{Takeaways}

\begin{itemize}

\item We relax the i.i.d. assumption from CATE estimation methods.

\item We  propose a method to select CATE models that are robust under a family of distributional changes in the data.

\item The proposed method shows positive results on a limited number of simulation scenarios.


\end{itemize}
